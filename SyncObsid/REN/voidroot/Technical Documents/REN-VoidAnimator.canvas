(ie. if it's a button it has a hover anim)\n\nIt gives you a component with operating animations that are played on your signal.\n\nYou can mix different animation operations as chains of effects to it using a visual effect chain controller and preview the changes.\n\nHas built-in shader attachment for pixel level effects like glitches.\n\nHas built-in audio attachment with pre-made audio assets for each transition and effect."},
